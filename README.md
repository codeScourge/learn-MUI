# learn-MUI

A repo I used for teaching myself the ReactJS MUI library. Components contains files with a single lesson from [this course](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLC3y8-rFHvwh-K9mDlrrcDywl7CeVL2rO).    
The projects folder holds the miniprojects which I decided to build along the way to deepen and solidify my skills.
